<p>Summer was
here at last.
The winter
had not been
very cold, but
it had stayed
long after
spring should
have come.
Now it seemed
almost too
warm, perhaps
because only a
few days before
it had
been so cold.</p>

<p>It was the end of the school-year, the time for
examinations and the giving of prizes, and these last
few days were hard on both teachers and children.</p>

<p>Already a holiday breeze was blowing over the
budding and blossoming country, and the hum of
insects and the singing of birds made one think
of the fun that would come with vacation.</p>

<p>Among the scholars bending over their desks was
Bertha, a little dark-haired girl, her black eyes fringed
with long lashes. She was twelve years old and was
working for her first certificate. Morning and afternoon
she came to the school, sometimes brought by
the maid, but more often by her mother.</p>

<p>As a child she had always been petted and spoiled
by her parents, who gave her all the candies and toys
she wanted. Her little room was crowded with dolls
and playthings of all sorts, each of which had its name.</p>

<p>There were fair dolls, dark dolls, white dolls, black
dolls, big dolls&mdash;some even were life-size&mdash;fat dolls,
thin dolls, little dolls, tiny dolls; there were jointed
dolls, who opened and shut their eyes; there were
dolls who could talk, and dolls who kept silent. I
believe myself that Bertha loved the silent ones best;
they could not answer back, you see.</p>

<p>Uncle Jean, the brother of Bertha's father, had
made a point of giving Bertha her first toy. He
brought her, one fine morning, a lovely white poodle,
which had pink silk ribbons on it and little tinkly
bells. There was a spring inside, and when Bertha
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
pressed this gently with her fingers, the dog barked.
It was altogether so well made that you would have
thought it was alive.</p>

<p class="pmb1">When he gave it to her, before the whole family,
Uncle Jean made her the following speech:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
  <img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="481" height="600" alt="Desk with toys...and dog puppet" title="" />
</div>


<p class="p1 pmb1">"My dear niece, I give you this dog rather than a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
doll, because the dog is the friend of man, but a
doll&mdash;" here he mumbled into his big moustache a lot
of long words which got so mixed up with the barking
of the dog that nobody could catch them. Perhaps
it was just as well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="400" height="446" alt="Woman with child, man with dog" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Uncle Jean was always saying funny clever things
to make people laugh but really he was very wise and
thoughtful. Everybody liked him and he was invited
places all the time.</p>

<p>So Bertha's first plaything was this dog, who was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
then and there given the name of "Clown." Why
they hit upon this name I really cannot say.</p>

<p class="pmb1">After the dog there came, one by one, all the dolls
I just told you about, but Bertha loved Clown best.
You see, he was the only dog she had, but there were
many dolls to share her love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">
  <img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="310" height="277" alt="Bertha and dog puppet" title="" />
</div>
<div class="pmb1">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Every night he was put to bed at the feet of his little
mistress, who, each morning as she woke up, took him
into her arms and hugged him tight.</p>

<p>Later on, as Bertha grew older, she would talk to
him for hours, Clown answering with long barks,
really made by Bertha's fingers pressing on the spring.</p>

<p class="pmb1">They were then, as I was just now telling you, on
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the eve of the examinations. Bertha was working
her hardest. For several days she had been very, very
quiet, and just a little worried; her parents were quite
anxious and petted her even more than usual.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
  <img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="360" height="585" alt="Bertha and her mother" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">At last one morning, when her mother asked her
what was the matter, Bertha decided to tell her all
about it. After a long sigh she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother, if I pass my examination, will you give
me what I have been wanting for a long, long time?"</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for an answer, she went on:</p>

<p>"I want a dog, a little dog, but&mdash;a real live one. It
will be quite easy to get one if you will only let me.
Miss Lewis, our principal at school, is going to have
some. Don't laugh, Mother, it is quite true. She told
me so herself, and she promised to give me one if you
and father would let me have it. Oh, you will ask
father, won't you? Everything depends on him," she
murmured, snuggling up to her mother and hugging
her, "for I know you will let me, won't you, sweetest?
Oh, I am so happy, so proud to think of having a dog of
my very own." She was so excited, she clapped her
hands and danced for joy.</p>

<p>Bertha passed her examinations with honors and,
true to his promise, her father said that she might have
her dog.</p>

<p class="pmb1">After that nobody could think of anything but the
doggie, so eagerly expected. What would he be like?
What color would he be? She imagined him now
black, now white, now black and white, now sandy.
She asked all sorts of questions of everybody she met.
She dreamed of him, she thought of him all day long,
of nothing but him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
  <img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="320" height="580" alt="Marie with a letter for Bertha" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Her father told her not to get too excited, as he was
afraid she might be disappointed. Bertha listened
at last to his good advice, but even then she could not
resist stopping to look in at the windows of the leather
goods stores, where muzzles, collars, chains, leashes,
whips, boots for the mud, coats and blankets&mdash;in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
short, all the things a dog could need&mdash;were
displayed.</p>

<p>Dreamily she gazed at the poodles and pet-dogs
which passed her, led by fine ladies.</p>

<p class="pmb1">But, what was this? Marie with a letter for the
little girl? Bertha recognized the handwriting. Miss
Lewis had written to tell her the great news&mdash;the
puppies had arrived. Five of them. Five little puppies,
each with different markings, and Miss Lewis
graciously invited her pupil to come and choose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="600" height="339" alt="Mrs. Lewis' dog with five puppies" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Bertha was breathless, wild with joy.</p>

<p>"Mother, Mother, let's go quick! My doggie is
waiting."</p>

<p class="pmb1">Dressing hastily, mother and daughter went straight
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to Miss Lewis's house, where they found her beside a
beautiful black poodle, who, jealously ready to protect
her babies, looked at her visitors as though she didn't
quite trust them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
  <img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="350" height="342" alt="Little black puppy" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">After much hesitation
Bertha at
last decided upon a
sturdy little black
puppy, with a
white lock set
exactly in the
middle of his forehead,
like a pennant,
which made
him look very
quaint and cunning.
Perhaps it was the white lock that decided
Bertha, anyhow, directly she saw him, the darling,
she cried:</p>

<p>"That's the one I want! I choose him."</p>

<p>She couldn't have told you herself why she chose
that one. She thought his brothers and sisters all very
pretty, but he was the one she wanted. Love is often
like that.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Bertha, who already loved the puppy she had chosen,
wanted to take him home with her at once, but her
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
mother and even Miss Lewis insisted that he was too
young yet. Just think, he was only just born. It
would not be wise to bring him up on the bottle&mdash;such
a bother&mdash;and then the risk of sickness and all
that might cause his little mistress all sorts of worry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="600" height="475" alt="Puppy with mother" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Bertha saw that they were right, but she begged
Miss Lewis to let her come every day to see him, to
which her teacher willingly agreed.</p>

<p class="pmb1">After that Bertha did not let a day go by without
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
a visit to her little friend. The mother-dog soon grew
used to seeing the girl; she was a trifle greedy, I must
confess, and her affection was quite won by the cakes
and dainties which Bertha brought her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
  <img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="440" height="471" alt="Clown as puppy" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">For more than a month the puppy stayed with his
mother. He had to be entirely weaned before his
mistress could have him.</p>

<p class="pmb1">In the meantime Bertha was busier than ever,
busier than she would have been if she had had the
doggie at home. She was making all sorts of preparations
for him. She bought a regular outfit for her
baby, as she called him, and she even wanted to get
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
him nightcaps and pajamas. These her mother did
not think necessary. However, to make up for not
getting them, she had to get all kinds of other things:
curtains for his bed, cushions, ribbons, a collar, a
leash, even a tiny muzzle. Her doggie must be well
provided for.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="300" height="354" alt="Dog on book" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">After hesitating a long time over the name to be
given to the newcomer, Bertha decided to call him
"Clown," after her first dog, Uncle Jean's toy.
Besides, the name suited him exactly; he was very
active, and had a happy look and clumsy ways which
made you laugh.</p>

<p class="pmb1">He would spend hours chasing his tail, but as it was
rather short and his body very chubby, he never quite
caught it. The look of disgust which came over his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
face when he finally gave up was so funny that Bertha
laughed till the tears came to her eyes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="300" height="373" alt="Clown" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Meantime all his
brothers and sisters had
been given away. This
did not worry Clown a
bit; he certainly did not
lose his appetite over it;
on the contrary, he
stuffed himself nearly
sick. He drank so hard
that sometimes the milk
would run out of his
nose. Eating like that,
he soon became a big fat
doggie, strong and
active, barking at everything, and snapping at flies.</p>

<p>When Clown was at last old enough to be taken
away, Bertha, with her faithful maid, Marie, went to
get the little fellow and bring him to his new home.</p>

<p class="pmb1">They had a regular christening party to which all
Bertha's little friends and their brothers were invited.
There was a fine lunch with lots of candy; they even
drank fruit-juice punch. The party was talked of
long after by the guests, who enjoyed themselves
immensely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="300" height="597" alt="illustration p.30" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">But, alas, a month
afterward, a cloud
dimmed Bertha's happiness.
Uncle Jean
did not like the looks
of Clown. It is true
that although his coat
was well brushed and
curled and perfumed,
the dog did look more
like a little bear than a poodle.
Uncle Jean was very particular
about the training of dogs. He had
horses and dogs of his own (he even
had a monkey) and he insisted that
his grooms keep all his animals, of
whom he was very fond, slick and
clean.</p>

<p>No poodle of his would have
remained unshaven, with tail uncut,
when all proper poodles are shaven
and have their tails trimmed off.</p>

<p>He said so much about it that at last it was decided
that the dog should be sent to the veterinary surgeon,
who in a minute had cut off Clown's tail and shaved
him like a lion, leaving just a rim of hair around his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
hind-quarters as an ornament, and a bushy tuft at the
end of his trimmed-off tail.</p>

<p>Poor little Clown was terribly upset.</p>

<p class="pmb1">He was brought home looking like a martyr and
horribly ashamed; for more than a week he was
feverish and had fits of trembling. Bertha cried and
cried. I need not tell you what care she took of him.
You can guess that for yourself.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
  <img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="350" height="356" alt="Clown was terribly upset" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Cured at last, he
soon forgot about
having his hair
cut, and became a
proud, fine-looking
dog. Only he
could not bear the
sound of shears,
and when he heard
the dog-clippers go
past he would fall
into a rage, wanting
to run out and
bite them, barking
furiously in chorus with the other dogs who felt as he
did about it.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Bertha ceased to be angry with her uncle. When
as she led Clown on the leash she noticed people turn
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
round and go into raptures over the looks of her dog,
it made her feel very proud.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="600" height="605" alt="Dog training" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">The dog grew so fast you could almost see him
getting bigger. His training was undertaken carefully,
Uncle Jean looking after it himself. Clown
learned quickly and easily; he was naturally intelligent
and had a truly wonderful memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">Uncle Jean found that Clown learned tricks easily&mdash;he
seemed to like to show off&mdash;but in other ways he
was not so easily managed. He was rather fond of
having his own way, and his young mistress got more
than one scolding for spoiling him. He insisted on
being fed from her own hand, and he would sleep
nowhere but in Bertha's room.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 270px;">
  <img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="270" height="433" alt="Clown learned tricks easily" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Men are conceited things
and think themselves much
wiser than the animals, but
I don't believe they know so
very much more after all.
It's a question whether the
animal's instinct isn't of as
much use to him as intelligence
is to man. Anyhow,
animals can understand one
another, even animals of
different kinds. I rather
think they understand one
<em class="gesperrt">another</em> better than we
understand them.</p>

<p class="pmb1">However that may be,
Clown was a wonder. You had only to say what you
wanted him to do and he would do it like an old hand.
He would jump through a hoop, give his right or left
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
hand as he was asked, leap backward or forward, walk
on his hands or feet&mdash;all this was child's play to him.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 290px;">
  <img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="290" height="416" alt="Clown's tricks" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">He dearly loved games&mdash;such
as he could play,
of course. He would toss
a ball, hunt the thimble,
and without ever making
a mistake bring back the
handkerchief to its owner,
grinning with delight.
With a policeman's helmet
on his head, and a piece
of sugar on his nose, looking
like a soldier on
parade, he would carry
arms for hours at a time.
What surprising things he
could do! You would scarcely believe it, but he had
learned to recognize certain letters of the alphabet
and to put together the word, B-E-R-T-H-A.</p>

<p>He never made a mistake in spelling the name of his
little mistress, although that was, however, the first
and last word that they succeeded in teaching him.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Alas, with all his good qualities Clown had his
failings. Nobody, sad to say, is faultless. He was
given to stealing. A sugar bowl left within his reach
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
had a very bad time of it; he ate all the sugar, to the
very last piece, and it was a lucky thing if he didn't
break the bowl as well. Clown was greedy, there was
no denying.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="Clown eats sugar from the sugar bowl" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">After a while, sadly spoiled, unfortunately, he began
to put on airs of independence. His leash made him
impatient, and when he met a dog friend running free
about the streets he would behave badly, forcing
Bertha to drag him along like a toy without wheels,
or he would wallow in the dust, both of which made his
mistress very angry.</p>

<p class="pmb1">One day, when he had gone marketing with Marie,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
he managed to slip his head out of his collar and set
off with a rush to join a group of very ill-kept tramp
dogs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="500" height="535" alt="Marie and Clown" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">Poor Marie called and called, but in vain. Then she
ran after him. Not only could she not overtake him
but, worse still, at a turning in the road she lost sight
of him altogether. In vain she searched the neighborhood,
questioning everyone she met, but no one had
seen poor Clown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="600" height="517" alt="Clown running away from Marie" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The excited woman began to cry, not daring to
return home without the dog. Anxiously she walked
up and down in front of the house. After about half
an hour she heard a noise and soon saw a band of
children appear, yelling and running after a poor
wretched, muddy little dog, to whose tail was tied an
old tin can which knocked against the pavement with
every jump he took.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Marie could not believe her eyes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="300" height="457" alt="Clown in Marie's arms" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">You would <em class="gesperrt">never</em>
have known it was
poor Clown, so terrified,
his eyes almost
bursting from his
head, his tongue hanging.
As soon as he
caught sight of Marie,
he hurled himself into
her arms, covering her
with both kisses and
mud.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Marie was so sorry
for him that she hadn't
the heart to scold the
poor animal. She took
him in her apron and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
after untying the horrible tin can he had been dragging
after him, she carried him up to her room and
there bathed him from head to foot. He needed it, I
can tell you.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="400" height="503" alt="illustration p.39" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">"If this will only be a lesson to him," she said to
herself; but she did not dare to tell anybody about his
running away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
  <img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="460" height="498" alt="Clown playing with ball" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">After this adventure Clown behaved very much
better and was quiet and obedient for several weeks.
When his mistress took him out he followed her
quietly on the leash, without making any objection.
Thus his life flowed on, calm and happy. He had
everything a dog could wish, except, perhaps, a little
more freedom. In the house, in the garden, in the
country, he could run about as he pleased, but in the
streets Bertha always kept him on the leash. The
leash was held by a hand very gentle, very easy and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
discreet, but in spite of that he always resented it.
He had tried everything he could to get rid of it.
When he could get at it, he would hide it or chew it
up so that it was not fit to use. Bertha just bought
another one at once. Then, to show his hatred of it,
Clown invented all sorts of tricks, winding himself
round the feet of passers-by, getting himself caught
behind a tree, planting his feet and refusing to move.
That was his revenge.</p>

<span class="small">THE CAPTURE OF CLOWN</span></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />

<div class="figright" style="width: 310px;">
  <img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="310" height="486" alt="Clown goes out of the door" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Generally Clown
slept late and did not
leave Bertha's room,
where he had his bed,
until he was ready for
the public eye&mdash;that
is to say, until he was
combed and brushed,
beribboned and perfumed.</p>

<p class="pmb1">One morning, I don't
exactly know why, the
maid entered Bertha's
room long before getting-up
time, and
going out again she
forgot to shut the door.
Clown, once awakened,
did not go to sleep again. What he was thinking about
I can't tell you. Anyhow he yawned, stretched himself
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
slowly, then crept slyly toward the half-open door,
pushed it softly with his nose, and there he was in the
hall. It was not far to the kitchen and the pantry door
which opened onto the back steps leading into the
street was not shut either.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
  <img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="520" height="453" alt="Clown" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">"'Tis opportunity makes the thief," so they say.
After a moment's hesitation, after looking carefully
at the steps to be sure no one would see and stop him,
Clown thought that it would be rather pleasant to take
a morning stroll through the streets; he felt proud for
once not to be held in leash, and was delighted at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
thought of being able to rout at his own sweet will
amongst the heaps of garbage, the one thing of all
others strictly forbidden him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="600" height="604" alt="Dogs following man with parcel" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Nobody saw him, nobody stopped him. He reached
the door; a glance, a sniff here and there, and he was
free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">Once outside he walked quietly for a hundred yards
or so, nose in air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">
  <img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="560" height="542" alt="Man with parcel catches Clown" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Soon, however, he was ready to come back and was
just thinking of going in again when he saw at the
corner of the street five or six other dogs following a
man who was carrying a parcel. This made him
curious; there was a queer smell, too, which attracted
him. In a trice he had joined the group.</p>

<p>"After all," he said to himself pretty soon, "though
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the smell is appetizing enough, I have better than that
at home. Good-bye, my friends, and good luck. I am
going home to breakfast."</p>

<p class="pmb1">Whereupon, giving up the chase, he turned to go
home. Alas! it was too late. The man had just thrown
a lasso, which caught Clown around the neck. He
tried to get away, to cry out, to struggle, to bite; the
knot tightened, choking him. He was muzzled, and
forced by kicks&mdash;the first he ever received in his
life&mdash;to go, willy-nilly, with the dog-thief. For that
was what the man was, and one of the very worst of
his kind, too.</p>

  <img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="480" height="687" alt="Clown in the kennel" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">It was a fine day, and Paris began to awaken. In
the streets there were more and more passers-by,
and the man walked faster and faster; Clown, full of
sad thoughts, let himself be dragged along. With
hanging head he was thinking of his little mistress,
how probably at this very minute she had discovered
his flight. He saw her despair, and big tears rolled
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
from his eyes; he trembled from head to foot. Perhaps
he would never see her again! At this, heart-rending
sobs burst from his poor little throat. Sometimes he
tried to drive away these sad thoughts by imagining
he would soon have a chance to escape from his torturer.
If only they did not take him too far from
Paris, his native town, he could find his way home
again easily enough with his eyes shut.</p>

<p>After a long and painful walk through streets and
avenues, the man stopped at last in front of a wretched
hut. At the end of a yard, in a corner, there was a
horrible kennel, with no cover, surrounded by a strong
wooden fence.</p>

<p>Clown, although worn out in mind and body, pulled
back with disgust from the door of this evil-smelling
hole. The man pushed him in brutally with his foot,
and with another well-directed kick shut the door to
behind him. Then Clown gave himself up to despair.
He felt utterly lost. He would never see his dear ones
again. How foolish he had been! How miserable he
was!</p>

<p class="pmb1">Attracted by his cries and tears, three beautiful
setters, who had been stolen the day before, came out
of the back of the kennel and grouped themselves
around the newcomer. They did their best to comfort
and console him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">After telling one another their sad stories, they
talked over ways of escape. The very idea of getting
away cheered them up a lot.</p>

<p class="pmb1">It was clear that they were all to be sold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="620" height="482" alt="Dogs at the dog market" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Next morning they were all tightly chained to one
another and the man, whip in hand, led them to the
dog-market.</p>

<p class="pmb1">This market was held in a large square, slightly
shaded by big elm trees. Ragged old women, squatting
on their heels, or crouching on old chairs or
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
baskets, held little dogs on their knees, petting them,
cleaning them, offering them for sale to anyone who
stopped to look. Some people had dogs on leashes.
Suspicious-looking men walked dogs to and fro.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
  <img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="480" height="555" alt="Women selling dogs at the dog market" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">In front there was a long line of hunting dogs of
every kind and breed; farther on, a line of pet-dogs;
then a group of poodles&mdash;newly shaved and beribboned.
Here and there were cats, monkeys, parrots,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
birds of all kinds, and, lastly, guinea-pigs and white
rats.</p>

<p>All these creatures barked, whined, mewed, chattered,
screamed. The din was beyond description.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Clown, confused, a white poodle on either side of
him, was silent. With hanging head he pretended
that he had quite given up the thought of escape,
but just the same, when no one was looking, he turned
his eyes quickly from side to side, ready to seize the
first chance to get away.</p>

<span class="small">CLOWN ESCAPES</span></h2>
<div class="pmb1">&nbsp;</div>


<p class="pmb1">It was not long before Clown's absence was noticed
in his old home. The whole household was alarmed.
They searched the house from top to bottom, whistling,
calling to him, weeping. The servants ran to and fro;
nobody could understand how the dog had got away.
Huddled in an arm-chair, Bertha sobbed, with hardly
the heart or strength to move. In vain they searched
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
all Paris. The police were informed, the pound
visited, the description and photograph of Clown scattered
broadcast. A large reward was offered to anyone
finding him or giving information about him. In
spite of all this, the day and night passed without
news of the dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="Clown at the dog market" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">On the advice of the Chief of Police, Bertha went
next morning to the dog-market, accompanied by
Marie and the footman. No sooner was she there
than Clown, without seeing her, even, sniffed her from
afar. He pulled so hard on his chain that he nearly
broke it. Alas, where he was, Bertha could not see
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
him. The thief understood at once that something
was the matter. He seized the unhappy dog before
he knew what was happening, flung him into a box
near at hand and banged down the lid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
  <img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="450" height="467" alt="Clown is sold" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">'Twas thus that poor Clown, at the moment when his
rescue seemed certain, learned to his cost that there
are times in this life when it is wise to hide one's
feelings.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Anyhow, his young mistress was looking for him
everywhere. This was enough to make him feel much
more cheerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
  <img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="460" height="572" alt="Clown leaves Paris" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">That day Clown was sold. When he saw the money
counted out, he understood and was at first quite
delighted, but his joy did not last long. He soon discovered
from the gestures of the two men that his new
owner did not live in Paris and that he was leaving
that very night, for his home far, far away in the
south. Then Clown felt desperate. He shook with
rage and fear lest he should be lost forever. He was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
so upset by his bad luck that he hardly heard the thief
offer to take him to the station that evening in time
for the train, and his new owner accept the offer.</p>

<p class="pmb1">He lost all hope on hearing that, for his last chance
of escape would be gone the minute he was taken
away from Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
  <img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="550" height="466" alt="Clown shut up in the dog kennel" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">On the way to the station Clown was held so tightly
that he saw it would be no use to struggle. When he
reached there at nightfall, he was shut up in the hated
dog-kennel until the time came for the train to start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
  <img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="450" height="577" alt="Clown released from the dog kennel" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">When the noisy whistles blew, as they always do
when the great expresses are about to draw out, and
the train started with that horrid grating sound they
always make, Clown began to sob wildly and to howl
in a most dismal fashion. To make it all the worse
he saw through the iron bars of his cage the shadows
of the last houses of his native city. For a moment
he thought he should go mad. Little by little the cool
evening air revived him, calmed his fever. Snuggling
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
down in a corner of his box, he determined to wait for
the chance of escape which must come some time or
other. He would cross the whole of France, if necessary,
to find his beloved mistress. Death alone could
deprive him of his one great hope.</p>

<p>At last, after passing through Burgundy, the
express stopped. It was morning and already quite
light. Clown saw his new master approach his prison
and open the padlock so that he could come out and
stretch his legs on the platform. The prisoner did not
hesitate. No sooner was he free than he was off like
a shot, tearing along the platform, then back along
the railway track, taking no notice of the calls of his
master or of the laughter of the travelers, to whom
the whole thing was a joke.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Quite happy now, forgetting all his past troubles
and full of hope again, he thought that, thanks to his
hurried flight, he could not be so very far from Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">All morning Clown walked bravely along the dusty
road, but at last he began to feel hungry and tired.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
After going miles and miles, towards midday he was
lucky enough to meet in the fields a large flock of
sheep, guarded by sheep-dogs. These dogs, when
Clown told them his tragic story, were very kind to
him and even asked him to share their dinner with
them. But they could give no real help as to how to
get to Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"All that we know is, that it is several days' walk
from here, down that way," they told him, pointing
with their paws.</p>

<p class="pmb1">After comforting himself with cheese, milk, and
brown bread, Clown left them, thanking them politely
for their kindness. All the same, as he set off, he felt
very sad, for he saw that the good dogs he had just
visited did not think that his plan seemed a very
good one, and he began to be afraid he never should
get back home after all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="Clown fleeing" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">To make him still more uneasy, toward four o'clock
the wind began to blow and big clouds darkened the
sky. Clown fled along as fast as his legs would carry
him, trying to get ahead of the awful storm which
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
hung above his head. But the clouds went faster than
he did; the lightning and thunder grew nearer and
nearer, louder and louder.</p>

<p class="pmb1">With the storm had come darkness. Now torrents
of rain hurled themselves madly from the sky. The
poor dog was terribly frightened. He didn't know
where to go, what road to take, valley, forest, or hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="Clown runs wildly" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">Wet to the skin, muddy, blinded by the rain, deafened
by the thunder, he saw no sign of shelter. He
just ran on wildly, battered by rain and wind, faster
and faster, following his nose.</p>

<h2>4<br /><br />

<span class="small">CLOWN AT THE CIRCUS</span></h2>
<p class="pmb2" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;">
  <img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="380" height="459" alt="Clown with Marie in front of a mirror" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">However, as he
reached the edge of the
wood, the rain grew less
violent. Night was coming
on but among the
trees he could see bright
lights shining.</p>

<p>Drawing nearer,
Clown made out
some kind of a big
camp; carriages
and closed wagons
and tents stood
out against the
background of the
forest. At last he
saw people and
animals coming and going in all directions.</p>

<p>When he was quite close to this busy scene, Clown
stopped, breathless and anxious, sniffing the air,
listening keenly to the slightest sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">He was not quite satisfied, and in his doubt he
thought of going farther on the chance of finding other
shelter. But he was more tired than he was afraid.
Plucking up his courage, poor Clown crept slowly
toward the larger of the two lighted vans that stood
on the edge of the woods.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
  <img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="590" height="497" alt="Clown finds a big camp" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">Just at this moment the curtain that closed the rear
of one of these vans opened and a young girl came out
and stood on the doorstep. She wore a gleaming
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
costume of spangles, with a very short, fluffy skirt,
covered with shiny stones, and she had little satin
slippers on her feet, and the daintiest of pink stockings.
A plaid shawl hung from her shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
  <img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="320" height="400" alt="Clown in front of a doorstep" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Clown was dumbfounded. Never had he seen his
dear mistress in such a dress. While he was gazing
in astonishment at her, the girl stretched out her hand
to see if it was still raining. As she looked down she
caught sight of our poor little doggie, who, squatting
in front of her, wet through and muddy, raised imploring
eyes, waiting till she should take pity on him.</p>

<p>"What's this? A lost dog?" and, bending toward
him, she coaxed him nearer, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor doggie, poor little thing."</p>

<p class="pmb1">Clown went forward at once, trembling, anxious to
please but still half afraid. He let this strange girl
pet him, and made himself so agreeable, so eager and
so interesting, that ten minutes later she had him all
cleaned, combed and brushed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
  <img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="520" height="364" alt="Clown on a pile of blankets" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Having won the favor of this kind-hearted girl,
Clown became once more his old handsome self.</p>

<p>On a soft pile of blankets he passed an excellent
night. Now and again strange noises troubled his
ears, but completely worn out, and drowsy from so
much fresh air, he fell asleep again and dreamed
golden dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">The next morning the sky was clear again and the
air was fresh and balmy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="Clown visits the animals of the circus" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">Clown was awakened at dawn by the sound of
people rushing about, packing up, just as though they
were moving house. Without leaving his bed, his eyes
still half-closed, he listened closely, and finally understood
with what kind of people he had to deal. Then
were explained the low growls which had so puzzled
and frightened him during the night. The carriages,
the cages, were the dwelling places of strange and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
terrifying animals, such as he remembered having seen
at the fair of Neuilly, whither his dear mistress,
Bertha, had taken him one evening when he was still
a baby.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="Clown watches boxes" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">He had, then, fallen in with an immense traveling
circus which, constantly on the move, gave performances
in the principal cities of the world. Just now
it was headed, by gentle stages, for the center of
France. Clown was quite comforted and happy at the
thought of one day or another reaching Paris. Then&mdash;then&mdash;then
he would manage somehow to see her
again, her for whom he yearned, her whom he loved
with all his faithful little heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">Traveling this way was much nicer than running
along the highroad. He was a sturdy fellow, but, all
the same, that one day of walking under such conditions
had made him somewhat thin. In short, he had
had enough of it, especially when he remembered
that he hadn't the least idea how to get to Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
  <img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="580" height="472" alt="Clown at the lions' cages" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Slipping cautiously under the tents which sheltered
the cages, Clown took a good look around the place.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The stables, huge affairs, contained no less than one
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
hundred and fifty horses of all kinds and colors. He
saw, too, three monstrous elephants, dromedaries,
giraffes, zebras, donkeys, and even pigs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
  <img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="390" height="425" alt="A polar bear" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Then came the turn of the menagerie&mdash;a fine collection
of lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, foxes,
hyenas, boars. What didn't he see? Boxes full of
snakes, crocodiles, monkeys in cages&mdash;a chimpanzee
who was walking about all alone gave him a terrible
fright.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Parrots of every hue swayed on swinging perches,
uttering, for no reason that Clown could see, harsh discordant
cries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="620" height="383" alt="Elephants" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Thus he passed slowly through the whole menagerie,
seeing all the animals. He even grew bold enough
to lap freely at a large lake of milk, put there, he
thought, for the snakes and monkeys, who are very
fond of it. After this light breakfast he felt stronger
and more light-hearted. He spent some time visiting
and making much of his new mistress, and then went
on to finish his visit with the animals so happily begun.</p>

<p>Passing close to the elephants, he noticed their small
intelligent eyes, contrasting so queerly with their huge
size. While he was wondering about them, Clown, who
was by nature very curious, drew nearer, wanting to
sniff more closely at those long noses which swayed
so slowly and calmly from side to side. He succeeded
in getting close enough to touch them, but at the slightest
movement of the trunk he leaped back, his tail
between his legs, although he just had to return.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Suddenly, without being in the least hurt, he felt
himself lifted like a feather, and cleverly drawn into
the elephant-house. Now it was the elephants' turn
to sniff at him. One blew upon his nose until he could
scarcely breathe, while another gently pinched his
hind-quarters, and they all laughed at the figure he
cut. I can tell you, Clown did not enjoy all this one bit.
He did not even dare to show his teeth, he was so
afraid of being torn to pieces if he made the slightest
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
movement. Those five minutes in the air seemed to
him very long and terrible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
  <img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="420" height="556" alt="Clown 'in the air'" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">At last he was gently put upon his feet again. He
made one bound for liberty, a bound which brought
him close to the giraffes. Here again he felt a keen
pang of fear, for one of them, suddenly stretching his
long neck over the top of the box, touched him quite
unexpectedly with his long black tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">

<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
  <img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="162" height="680" alt="Ape ringing a bell" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">After this Clown was much more watchful and did
not come too close to the animals in the boxes. Even
the sound of a fly buzzing put him on his guard, and
this was a good thing for him, for he was in the midst
of a horde not always pleasant and sometimes quite
dangerous, where all sorts of accidents might have
happened to him. Fortunately he had escaped harm,
and these lessons made him very careful afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>A bell rang. Immediately commotion
arose; people moved about in
all directions; the feeling of unrest
showed more and more in the cages;
the inmates turned and twisted.
Clown wondered what could be the
matter. The wild beasts roared, the
horses whinnied; all the animals
clamored at once.</p>

<p>There was a medley of sounds
that was simply deafening. It was
feeding time.</p>

<p>Barrows full of fresh meat, loaves
of bread and bundles of forage,
were passed around freely. Each
animal was served in turn according
to his taste. After the first bite
or two calm gradually returned, in
the cages anyhow.</p>

<p>Clown was served apart and
lunched with excellent appetite.
His new mistress fairly stuffed him
with dainties, feeding him out of
her own hand. Her kindness made
Clown love her more and more.</p>

<p class="pmb1">When the animals were all fed and the men had
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
finished their own meals, the whole circus got ready
to move. By noon everything was ready, and at a
given signal, the entire troupe set off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
  <img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="460" height="434" alt="Clown - eating" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">As the country was flat, and they were to march
until evening before reaching their next stopping
place, orders were given to leave the shutters of the
cages open and to lead as many of the animals as possible
so that they might breathe in the fresh air and
stretch their legs a bit. You can guess that the
passing of such animals on the road frightened more
than one good peasant as they went along, although
everyone along the road was warned in time by the
tamer and his helpers, who rode at the head of the
procession so as to avoid accidents.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">It was in an elegant carriage, with good springs,
drawn by two fine young horses, that Clown made the
journey, seated beside his new mistress. The longing
to go quickly, made him hang his tongue out of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
mouth so that his white teeth showed under his black
moustache, and his eyes, turning from his mistress to
the splendid horses and back again, spoke his impatience
but at the same time his delight at the progress
they were making.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
  <img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="420" height="529" alt="The lion's trick" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">They went on and on, over miles of road bordered by
poplars, on into the golden dust, into the purple sunset.</p>

<p>A few miles more, and there lay Dijon.</p>

<p class="pmb1">A week before, the town had been prepared, by
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
bright-colored posters, for the coming of the great,
the marvelous circus. The walls and fences were
simply covered with pictures of the wonderful performance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
  <img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="470" height="415" alt="Circus riding" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Performing horses, looking huge as elephants,
clowns at their most amusing tricks, gymnasts doing
their most thrilling feats, all were pictured.</p>

<p>The tamer was there too, life-size, his head in the
mouth of Sultan, the big black Persian lion, while
Mademoiselle Reine, his charming daughter, Clown's
new mistress, beneath a cloudless sky drove four white
does, scattering flowers as she went.</p>

<p class="pmb1">At last the travelers came to the first country houses,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the vineyards and finally the spires, the tower of St.
John the Fearless and the other buildings of the capital
of Burgundy standing out against the evening
gloom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="620" height="382" alt="Setting up everything at a new town" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Before they entered the town, a halt was called.
Order was restored, the cages were shut, a moment's
rest was taken; then the troupe set out again, to
encamp at last on a large piece of open ground near
the gates of the city.</p>

<p>While the tents were being set up and the cages
placed&mdash;in short, the whole circus installed&mdash;a huge
procession bearing torches was organized, which rode
through Dijon, led by a band of music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">Knights in shining armor, mounted on magnificent
horses, handed out bills telling of a big performance
for the next evening and giving the program.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
  <img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="550" height="504" alt="Circus parade" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">The whole town was abroad to see and admire this
strange sight. Men, women, children, all came out to
meet them. It was a grand spectacle. Everybody
wanted a program. Just imagine a procession of elephants,
decked with gold and silver, a hundred and
fifty horses, some ridden and some driven but all with
magnificent harnesses, dromedaries, parade chariots
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
shimmering with gold and gleaming with precious
stones, and all these lighted up by flaring torches.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Clown had been dressed up for the occasion with
yellow ribbons, a color which suited his black coat to
perfection. Seated beside his new mistress he was
radiant upon a canopied chair of gold borne by four
zebras.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="600" height="456" alt="Zebras with palanquin" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">After going through the principal streets the troupe
at last came back to camp to rest for the night, still
followed by a vast crowd who did not think of sleep
until long after the circus fires were all out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">The night was calm, but at daybreak, as on the preceding
day, the noise in the camp started again, perhaps
even a little louder this morning on account of
the rehearsal which was to take place in preparation
for the evening's performance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="400" height="502" alt="Clown learning new trick" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Clown, always very curious, was present at all the
rehearsals and enjoyed them thoroughly&mdash;so much,
indeed, that he suddenly joined in and showed how
well he could skip. Then he wanted to jump over and
through everything. At last he got so excited that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Reine made him take a nice hot sugar-drink with a
little orange flower in it to calm him.</p>

<p class="pmb1">After this, Clown was considered one of the troupe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="400" height="462" alt="Clown and an ape" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Always on the watch, our doggie learned at breakfast
that three days hence they were to go to Fontainebleau,
where they were to give two performances, and
after that they were to set off for Paris, so as to arrive
in time for the opening of the big festival at Neuilly.</p>

<p class="pmb1">This made him so happy that for the moment he
quite forgot to eat. Then, hope in his soul and joy in
his heart, he made up his mind to do his very best at
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the next performance. He wanted to make all the
people admire him, to do something that would repay
Reine and her father for their kindness. Perhaps, too,
he hoped that by acting in this way he might get
talked about and get his name into the papers. Man
is vain and even a dog has his pride. His fame might
perhaps reach Bertha, his dear, tender, much-regretted
mistress. All this made him very serious when at last
the time for the performance arrived.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
  <img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="410" height="444" alt="Clown thinks about Bertha" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Beneath an immense tent, brilliantly lighted,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
decorated with garlands of foliage and flowers, the orchestra
struck up a joyous march.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Immediately the doors were flung open, and to the
sound of the music a great crowd poured into the huge
tent and took seats.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
  <img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="460" height="594" alt="The menagerie" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">For about an hour and a half the menagerie held the
floor. Then the animals were put back into their
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
cages. The wild beasts were obedient and rebellious in
turn; whips sounded continuously. The noise of
squibs, firecrackers, and growls almost drowned the
orchestra.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
  <img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="420" height="535" alt="Clown is being prepared for his performance" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Three times did the tamer put his head into Sultan's
great mouth. The excitement of the audience was
tremendous. They really thought he was done for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enough, enough," was heard on all sides, and amid
a thunder of applause, the first part of the performance
came to an end.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Then came an interval of ten minutes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="500" height="488" alt="Clown performing together with a clown" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">Soon the second part was announced by a cheerful
burst of music and the mad entrance of the clowns.
Our Clown only waited for this moment to show off his
talents, those already known and those nobody had
ever seen before. He entered barking, in a series of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
wild leaps exactly like those of his companions. It
was then that an artist in the troupe, astonished and
enthusiastic, took off his clown's collar, and then and
there put it round the neck of the poodle, naming him
the "Dog-Clown."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
  <img src="images/i_090.jpg" width="410" height="450" alt="Clown the dog-clown" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">So, for the second time, although until then they had
not known what to call him, he received the name of
Clown&mdash;"Dog-Clown."</p>

<p class="pmb1">During the first number, Clown set to work to copy
all the fun-making tricks of the other clowns, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
succeeded wonderfully well. Jumping through hoops and
over barrels, he gave himself up to the pleasure of the
thing; pleasing everyone so well that they clapped
and clapped until he came back several times.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="Horse performance" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">When the second number was called, there appeared
on the scene a very handsome horse led by a groom
dressed in the latest fashion. No sooner had they
entered than they were followed by Clown, who, as
he had seen done at the rehearsal, leaped with one
bound into the saddle. They had great difficulty in
coaxing him down. He could not see that this was
not the place for him. Reine, beautifully dressed in a
blue spangled gown, was placed with her father, in
the saddle and set off at a gallop, to the sound of music
and the gay cracking of the whip.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1">A clown joined the groom and Dog-Clown, who in
spite of everything had remained on the scene, began
to limp along behind them, to the great amusement
of the spectators.</p>

<p>He was the success of the evening. He even, it is
said, caused some jealousy among the artists of the
troupe. Thus from the very beginning Clown felt the
thrill of stage life and became a privileged actor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">Petted and adored by the public, he became so
important that he hardly ever appeared on the scene
until the end of the first and second numbers, a place
reserved always for the stars of the troupe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
  <img src="images/i_094.jpg" width="520" height="640" alt="Clown is balancing on a big ball" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">As was fitting, Dog-Clown had the place of honor on
the circus posters. Sometimes he was a groom,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
sometimes a clown, but he did not stop there. He succeeded
in showing that he was a mimic, and in a little play
written for him by the manager, he made a huge success.
Reine, who introduced Clown, shared the
applause with her favorite.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
  <img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="480" height="566" alt="One of Clown's tricks" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">Between whiles&mdash;and this was what astonished the
company most&mdash;the dog invented unexpected and
novel entrances. He gradually became a part of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
circus life, and always watching what was going on
around him, he was cute enough to make a place for
himself in every number, and the tricks he played
were so funny that everyone howled with laughter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;">
  <img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="530" height="536" alt="Clown and his dressmaker" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">When the circus left Dijon, the people of that town
were heart-broken. The mayor himself even begged
that the manager give a few more performances. In
vain. The manager was sorry, but time pressed; he
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
had made arrangements for a certain date at Fountainebleau.</p>

<p>When Dog-Clown appeared for the first time in
public in this town, even before he began he received
such a welcome that he was moved to tears. The
people had heard all about him and were wild to see
him. In a moment the stage was covered with a mass
of good things, thrown to him from all parts of the
house, from the nearest seats to the farthest. Some
threw sugar, some cakes; the clown even picked up
cigars and oranges.</p>

<p>Dog-Clown, by way of thanks, gave such a performance
as even he had never given before. His success
was almost unbelievable. At last so great did his
fame become that the Paris papers took it up, giving
long accounts of this wonderful dog.</p>

<p>Clown was glad to be on the road again, for each
move brought him that much closer to Paris. Besides,
now that he was an important member of the company
he always rode in state beside Reine, with velvet
cushions to nap on if he chose.</p>

<p class="pmb1">It was late in the afternoon when they reached
Fountainebleau, so no performance was given till next
day, and the animals had a needed rest. Clown spent
his time in thinking up new tricks with which to surprise
the people who came to see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I must tell you that, as soon as Clown had shown
what an artist he was, and how wonderfully he could
adorn a collarette, the management had attached to his
person a dressmaker who made for him all sorts of
quaint costumes.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Soon he had a rich and thoroughly equipped wardrobe,
from a frock-coat to a bull's skin and horns, a
costume which he wore to act the bull in a mock bullfight
in which young dwarfs figured as matadors and
teased him.</p>

<h2>5<br /><br />

<span class="small">THE RETURN HOME</span></h2>


<p class="p1 pmb1">Meantime Clown was growing tired of his popularity.
The fame, the applause of the friendly public, the
pleasure he felt in knowing that Reine and her father
were doing a fine business, the liberty he enjoyed, the
honors paid him daily, all these worldly vanities
flattered his pride, but neither success nor his pleasant
relations with the members of the troupe could make
him happy.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
  <img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="620" height="373" alt="Members of the menagerie become ill" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">He was always longing for his dear mistress Bertha.
Often in the night, overtaken by a horrible nightmare,
he would wake with a start, not knowing where he
was. Like many other artists, comic on the stage, he
was silent and gloomy away from it.</p>

<p>After three big performances, given one after the
other, without counting rehearsals, some of the most
important members of the menagerie became ill, owing
to the heat and their hard work. It was the animals
who suffered most. For two days Sultan, whose appetite
was usually hard to satisfy, had refused his food&mdash;a
thing hitherto unheard-of.</p>

<p>One of the white bears complained of terrible colic;
the llamas sneezed continually; Hercules, the giant
elephant, with trunk rolled up like a snail, could
hardly stand upright; a giraffe trumpeted; the hippopotamus,
"Poivro," stung by mosquitoes, scratched
himself till his cage shook. From the hyena-cage came
forth dismal howls; two of the poor creatures, down
with toothache, were rolling about in agony. Several
horses, a zebra, and a rooster all felt very far from
well.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The truth was the whole troupe was worn out. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
manager, too, felt that a rest was absolutely necessary
for all of them. Everybody agreed that the director
should announce to the public, giving any reason he
chose, that for the next forty-eight hours there would
be no performances.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
  <img src="images/i_103.jpg" width="520" height="461" alt="Zebras are ill and spitting" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">No one was allowed even to visit the menagerie. It
was only after much delay and because he begged so
hard that one stranger was admitted. This was a
reporter from one of the important Paris newspapers,
who, having heard by the many-tongued mouth of
rumor of the queer tricks of Dog-Clown, was most
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
anxious to see the dog for himself, and if possible to
learn all about him, for he wanted his paper to be
the first to tell the people of Paris the true story of
this wonderful dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
  <img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="550" height="435" alt="Clown is also ill" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">At the time Clown was resting on a pile of blankets;
although he seemed to be asleep he was listening to
the conversation, for like a policeman, he always slept
with one eye open. As soon as he realized what it was
all about, he got up on his hind legs and went straight
to the reporter, understanding probably how much
what the newspaper said might help Bertha to find
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">He was polite as he could be to this reporter and
took great pains to show off before him, and&mdash;this
was really a flash of genius&mdash;succeeded three different
times, using as his letters the print on a rolled
placard lying near him, in putting together the word
"B-E-R-T-H-A," by placing his foot on the letters in
the right order.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
  <img src="images/i_105.jpg" width="340" height="258" alt="Clown and a reporter" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Greatly puzzled as to what it could mean the
reporter wrote down on his tablet the word Clown
had spelled. He could not help being surprised by
this strange sign of intelligence. He bowed respectfully
to this strangest of all subjects for interview, and
as he left him he said gravely:</p>

<p>"Delighted to have met you, my dear sir."</p>

<p>Clown returned his bow, no less politely. He felt a
trifle proud, perhaps, but he was charmed to have
made himself understood by a human being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">I leave you to imagine, dear friends, what a stir was
caused by this article which appeared on the front
page of the paper. It was headed:</p>

<p class="center"><span style="font-size:1.2em">DOG-CLOWN, OR THE DOG WITH A BRAIN</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
  <img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="520" height="532" alt="Clown returns the bow of the reporter" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">It gave details of Clown's wonderful tricks&mdash;it
described them as simply beyond belief&mdash;and ended
by calling upon men of science to come and see for
themselves this curious, this strangely gifted dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">That day Bertha, who since the moment of Clown's
disappearance had not ceased to mourn for him and
to seek him everywhere, was even sadder than usual,
having at last given up hope of ever seeing him again,
now that all her attempts had ended in failure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="300" height="422" alt="Bertha is crying" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">At noon her father came home to lunch as he generally
did. She ran to meet him and was struck by his
jovial manner. She guessed something pleasant was
in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">"You have good news, father dear?" she said.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
  <img src="images/i_108.jpg" width="350" height="364" alt="Bertha reads the newspaper with her father" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">"Well, I think so, but don't make too sure yet. I
really do think though that we have found your dog."</p>

<p>Bertha turned
pale and nearly
fainted for joy.
Her father read
her the article and
when he came to
the part where the
journalist told how
the dog had
spelled, without a
doubt, the name
"Bertha," she
cried:</p>

<p>"There's no
doubt about it! It is&mdash;it is my dog. Let's go&mdash;let's
go at once and get him!"</p>

<p>Two hours later the express train going at its fastest
to Fontainebleau, bore Bertha and her father and
mother.</p>

<p>There was a matinee that day. When Bertha and
her family took places beside the ring the performance
had already begun. The wild animals had been
shown and the second part of the performance
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
announced the appearance of Dog-Clown. This clever
individual kept them waiting a moment or two to
enhance the importance of his entry. The audience
began to grow impatient, cries of "Dog-Clown, Dog-Clown!"
were heard repeatedly.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment.</p>

<p>The father, the mother, the daughter sat motionless,
wide-open eyes glued to the door through which
he would come.</p>

<p>Like a ball which, vigorously hurled, bounces on the
pavement, Dog-Clown in a succession of wild leaps
went rapidly round the arena.</p>

<p class="pmb1">It was impossible to see his face, especially as he
was all dressed up and powdered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="At the matinee" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Having finished his first act, he went to the center
of the stage, and there standing on his hind legs made
his bow to the audience.</p>

<p class="pmb1">One sniff and he had recognized his owners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
  <img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="320" height="506" alt="Clown doing a trick" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">It was like a flash of lightning. Next instant he
had hurled off his clown's hat and leaped at them like
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a mad thing. He bounded over benches and fell, eyes
full of tears, whimpering softly, into the arms of
Bertha, who held him trembling and sobbing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="500" height="459" alt="Clown ran to Bertha" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">For a long time they clung to one another. This performance
amazed the public; the circus people thought
at first that this was just one of Clown's mad tricks&mdash;to
which they were growing accustomed&mdash;but soon
the truth was known when Reine, surprised and
anxious, came forward and asked for an explanation.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Bertha's father, "I am
extremely sorry to interrupt the performance, but, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
you see, the dog is ours. He was stolen from us. There
is no doubt at all that he is our dog, and I demand
that the manager give him back to us at once."</p>

<p class="pmb1">His decided tone convinced the young girl.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
  <img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="470" height="546" alt="Clown and Bertha" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">"As we are honest people," she said in her turn,
"and so that you may not think that we stole him, as
you seem to suggest, I will tell you how, three weeks
ago, he became one of us."</p>

<p class="pmb1">Thus begun, the conversation was continued in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
friendly way. True, a policeman was called, but only
to inform the audience, at the manager's request, of
the adventures of Dog-Clown who had delighted them
all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="500" height="399" alt="Leaving the circus" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">Reine wept for the handsome poodle who would now
no longer be with her on her travels, and there was
weeping and wailing in the menagerie, when his comrades
heard the news, for all the animals loved Clown.</p>

<p>This last scene was so affecting that the audience
itself, moved to tears, made no complaint.</p>

<p>It's a sad thing but true, alas, that what brings
happiness to one brings sorrow to others.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Bertha was too happy and this time too anxious, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
leave Clown any longer, even in the midst of these
kind circus people. She thanked them warmly for the
good care they had taken of her dog, Mademoiselle
Reine especially, whom she kissed very sweetly. She
promised, too, to take Clown to see her as soon as they
reached Neuilly, and giving her address, begged the
young girl to come to visit her in Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="600" height="547" alt="Weeping animals" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1 pmb1">After this Bertha departed in haste, hardly giving
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Clown time to say good-bye to his best friends and
comrades, all of whom wept at the parting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_115.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="Bertha and Clown leave Reine and the circus" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">That evening four joyful travelers took the train
for Paris. During the trip, Clown, seated on the
cushion between Bertha and her mother, his head
against the shoulder of his dear mistress, gazed at her
with moist, affectionate eyes. Licking her hands, wagging
his pompom of a tail, and uttering plaintive little
cries, he tried to tell her about all his past sufferings
and his present happiness.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Who could describe Clown's joy when he reached
home after his long journey, when he saw his own part
of town, his own house, his own room, where once
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
again he would have lovely naps and dream golden
dreams?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="500" height="447" alt="Clown and Bertha in the train" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">When he caught sight of Marie, he jumped into her
arms like a child. Marie burst into tears and could
not utter a word of reproach. He leaped all over the
footman, and did not forget even the cook. Then,
smiling to himself, he went off to see what they were
to have for dinner&mdash;and seemed well satisfied.</p>

<p>In a word, he took up once more his happy family
life, full of delightful things: pleasant strolls with
Marie, delightful wanderings with Bertha, caresses
lovingly given and returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1">From this memorable day, Clown, who had learned
his lesson, and grown wise by experience, was the
first to bring his leash when it was time to go out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="500" height="510" alt="Clown and Marie" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">He would carry it triumphantly in his mouth as if
to say, "Don't let's forget it!" For nothing in the
world could you get him to venture alone upon the
streets.</p>

<p class="pmb1">At the present time Clown is perfectly happy. His
adventures are all in the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 pmb1">Now that he no longer has anything to worry him he
is getting fatter and lazier, but he is always ready for
a frolic with his beloved mistress, Bertha. I am sure
that very few people who meet the contented dog and
his devoted mistress have any idea that this is the
famous Clown.</p>

<p class="p1 pmb1">As to the moral of this story, you have understood
it, I am sure; but don't forget it, dear little readers.
If you don't take the wise advice of your parents you
are likely to suffer. Just because he didn't obey his
little mistress, Clown, in spite of all his intelligence
and wit, was very nearly lost forever.</p>
